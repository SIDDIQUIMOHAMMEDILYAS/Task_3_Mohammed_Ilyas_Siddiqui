## 🌟 Features

This website is designed to be visually "Big" and attractive while maintaining clean code structure.

*   **Fully Responsive Layout:** Built entirely with CSS **Flexbox** to ensure perfect alignment on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
*   **Glassmorphism UI:** Extensive use of `backdrop-filter: blur()`, semi-transparent backgrounds (`rgba`), and border highlighting to create a frosted glass effect.
*   **Advanced Animations:**
    *   **RGBA Backgrounds:** Moving gradient meshes and floating blobs.
    *   **Scroll Reveal:** Elements fade in and slide up as the user scrolls down (using custom JavaScript).
    *   **Hover Effects:** Glowing borders, image scaling, and text color transitions.
*   **Single File Architecture:** All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained in one file for easy deployment and sharing.
*   **Semantic HTML5:** Uses proper tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`) for accessibility and SEO.

:root {
    --primary: #00f2fe;      /* Cyan */
    --secondary: #4facfe;    /* Blue */
    --accent: #f093fb;       /* Pink */
